# WTC-cs50
My student learning plan work for wethinkcode.

# WEEK 0
## Functions, Variables and Data Types
This week I learnt about: Functions. Arguments. Side Effects. Bugs. Return Values. Variables. Comments. Pseudocode. str. Parameters. int. Operators. Interactive Mode. float. def. Scope. return.
Fairly easy to understand, didn't struggle with the tasks at all!

# WEEK 1
## Conditionals
This week I went over: if. elif. else. or. and. bool. match.
Conditional statements in Python allow for the execution of specific code blocks based on whether a given condition evaluates to True or False. These statements are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program and enabling decision-making.

# WEEK 2
## Loops

This week I went over: while. for. list. range. continue. break. list. len. dict. None.
Loops in Python are control flow statements used to repeatedly execute a block of code.
Python primarily offers two types of loops: for loops and while loops.
break is used to stop a loop, while continue skips over certain code in a loop.

# WEEK 3
## Exceptions
This week I learnt about: Exceptions. SyntaxError. ValueError. try. except. NameError. else. pass. raise.
The **try** block contains the code that might raise an exception.
The **except** block specifies how to handle a particular type of exception if it occurs within the try block. Multiple except blocks can be used to handle different exception types.
An optional **else** block can be included, which executes if no exception occurs in the try block.

# WEEK 4
## Libraries
Modules. random. import. from. statistics. Command-Line Arguments. sys. sys.argv. IndexError. sys.exit. Slices. Packages. PyPI. pip. cowsay. APIs. requests. JSON. __name__.
